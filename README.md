# Arquivo-Tartaro-digital-panel
"Arquivo Tártaro" is a collection of online pages that provides teaching materials from the electronics course, aiming to support students using web resources. It was created by a pair of students from said course (including myself!). This project aims to facilitate the access and the organization of said materials through the internet.

<mark>For now, the pages are only available in Portuguese.</mark>
